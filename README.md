# Shopping cart
14th of 15 React Projects following [John Smilga](https://github.com/john-smilga/react-projects) tutorial from FreeCodeCamp course. 
This is a shopping cart project where you can delete item by item or all items, update the displayed quantity, the total of the shopping cart at the bottom and how many items are present in the cart at the top of the page.
The React Hooks useReduce and useEffect were used to provide data between various components, give functionality to the buttons, calculate the value in the cart and fetch data from an external API (which is providing the list of items).
